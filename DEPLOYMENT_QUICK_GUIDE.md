# üöÄ Quick Deployment Guide

## Current Status: FIXING BUILD ERRORS ‚ö†Ô∏è

### What We Just Fixed:

1. **‚úÖ Nixpacks Configuration** - Changed from `systemd + udev` to `eudev` to resolve package collision
2. **‚úÖ Environment Variables** - Moved hardcoded wallet addresses to environment variables
3. **‚úÖ Security** - Platform wallet and fees now configurable via env vars

---

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Dokploy

**CRITICAL**: Add these environment variables in your Dokploy dashboard:

1. Go to your app in Dokploy
2. Navigate to **Environment Variables**
3. Add the following:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_WALLET=CX6NvKqJwM1LVJmHL8XEpEcn8wrrEfLdxYhvNfZAS1P9
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT=0.005
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
```

### Step 2: Commit and Push Changes

```bash
# Add all changes
git add nixpacks.toml utils/tokenUtils.ts utils/swapUtils.ts env.example PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_GUIDE.md

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "fix: resolve nixpacks collision and move config to env vars"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment

1. Watch Dokploy deployment logs
2. Look for successful build completion
3. Verify app starts without errors

## ‚úÖ Pre-Launch Checklist

### Before Going Live (Do These in Order):

#### 1. **Test on Devnet** (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Connect wallet successfully
- [ ] Create 3-5 test tokens
- [ ] Execute 10+ buy transactions
- [ ] Execute 10+ sell transactions
- [ ] Verify fees go to platform wallet
- [ ] Test error scenarios (insufficient balance, etc.)

#### 2. **Security Audit** (30 mins)
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [ ] No secrets in code (already fixed ‚úÖ)
- [ ] RPC endpoint secured
- [ ] Rate limiting considered
- [ ] Input validation present

#### 3. **Switch to Mainnet** (15 mins)
Update environment variable:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=mainnet-beta
```

Consider upgrading to a paid RPC:
- **Helius**: https://helius.dev (Recommended)
- **QuickNode**: https://quicknode.com
- **Alchemy**: https://alchemy.com

#### 4. **Add Monitoring** (30 mins)
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry - 10 mins)
- [ ] Add analytics (Google Analytics - 5 mins)
- [ ] Configure uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot - 5 mins)
- [ ] Set up health check endpoint (10 mins)

#### 5. **Legal Requirements** (1 hour)
- [ ] Add Terms of Service
- [ ] Add Privacy Policy
- [ ] Add crypto risk disclaimers
- [ ] Add contact information

## üîí Production Environment Variables

**For Mainnet**, update to:

```bash
# Network
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=mainnet-beta

# Your production wallet
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_WALLET=<YOUR_PRODUCTION_WALLET>

# Fee (0.5% = 0.005)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT=0.005

# Optional: Premium RPC (highly recommended)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_KEY
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Still Failing
**Solution**: 
- Check Dokploy logs for specific error
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Try manual redeploy

### Issue 2: Wallet Not Connecting
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify network (devnet vs mainnet) matches wallet
- Clear browser cache

### Issue 3: Transactions Failing
**Solution**:
- Ensure sufficient SOL for fees
- Check RPC endpoint status
- Verify platform wallet is valid

### Issue 4: Slow Performance
**Solution**:
- Upgrade to paid RPC endpoint
- Enable caching
- Optimize bundle size
